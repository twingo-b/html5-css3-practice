        <h2>What is Ruby?</h2>
        <p>
            Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed
            and
            developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to its creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp.[11] It supports
            multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a
            dynamic
            type system and automatic memory management.

            Rubies have a hardness of 9.0 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. Among the natural gems only moissanite
            and diamond are harder, with diamond having a Mohs hardness of 10.0 and moissanite falling somewhere in
            between corundum (ruby) and diamond in hardness. Sapphire, ruby, and pure corundum are α-alumina, the most
            stable form of Al2O3, in which 3 electrons leave each aluminum ion to join the regular octahedral group of
            six nearby O2− ions; in pure corundum this leaves all of the aluminum ions with a very stable configuration
            of no unpaired electrons or unfilled energy levels, and the crystal is perfectly colorless.w
        </p>
        <p>
            When a chromium atom replaces an occasional aluminum atom, it too loses 3 electrons to become a chromium3+
            ion to maintain the charge balance of the Al2O3 crystal. However the Cr3+ ions are larger and have electron
            orbitals in different directions than aluminum. The octahedral arrangement of the O2− ions is distorted, and
            the energy levels of the different orbitals of those Cr3+ ions are slightly altered because of the
            directions to the O2− ions.[4] Those energy differences correspond to absorption in the ultraviolet, violet,
            and yellow-green regions of the spectrum.
